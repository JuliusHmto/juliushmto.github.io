In this project, I created a comprehensive demographic dashboard for Bee Cycle using Tableau, leveraging their sales dataset to provide detailed insights into customer demographics and purchasing behavior. The dashboard will feature visualizations of customer age, and geographic distribution, alongside sales performance segmented by product categories and subcategories (e.g., Bikes, Accessories, Clothing). Interactive elements such as filters will enable users to drill down into specific demographics or product details, helping Bee Cycle to tailor marketing strategies, optimize inventory, and drive sales growth through data-driven decision-making.
