This Boston housing price prediction project aims to comprehensively analyze and forecast housing prices. The objectives are twofold: firstly, to identify the key variables that influence the increase in house prices through detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA), uncovering patterns and trends within the dataset; and secondly, to utilize advanced machine learning models to accurately predict house prices. This dual approach provides valuable insights into the factors driving the housing market and delivers robust predictive models to support data-driven decision-making in real estate investments and policy planning.
