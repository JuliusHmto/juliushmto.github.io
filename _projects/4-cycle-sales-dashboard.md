In this project, I’ve created an engaging and insightful dashboard that tells the story of our cycle sales data. This dynamic visualization provides a comprehensive overview of key metrics such as total sales, total profit, and total sales per customer. A geographic map highlights the sales demographics, offering a clear visual representation of where our products are most popular. Additionally, a comparative analysis of units sold versus the previous year helps us track growth and identify trends. To enhance user experience and enable detailed analysis, I’ve included filters that allow users to slice the data by year, category, sub-category, and country. This interactive tool not only facilitates data-driven decision-making but also brings the narrative of our sales performance to life.
