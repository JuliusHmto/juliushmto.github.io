In this Telco customer churn prediction project, the challenge was to address the substantial loss of customers, as 26.53% of 7043 customers discontinued using Telco services, significantly impacting the company's revenue. The project comprised several critical steps. First, the causes of churn were identified through comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), which included examining customer demographics, service usage patterns, and contract details to uncover key factors contributing to churn. Next, advanced machine learning models were employed to predict future customer churn, providing the company with a proactive tool to identify at-risk customers. Finally, actionable recommendations were developed based on the analysis and predictions, offering strategic insights for minimizing the churn rate. These recommendations included targeted retention campaigns, personalized customer engagement strategies, and improvements in service offerings, aimed at enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty, thereby reducing churn and stabilizing revenue.
