The business problem is to accurately predict Boston housing prices for real estate investors, homebuyers, sellers, banks, and policymakers. The dataset's features significantly influence house prices, but the model may be overfitted due to its small size and lack of variation. Therefore, Ridge and Lasso models may not be suitable for predicting the median value of owner-occupied homes.
