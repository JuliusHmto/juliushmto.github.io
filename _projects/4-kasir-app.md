title: Kasir App
---

A web-based accounting app intended for RE (Ruang Entrepreneur, it some sort of canteen) on my campus, built with CodeIgniter 3. Made with all of my classmates and guided by our lecturer during the process. I create one modified version, added with some features and UI/UX improvements to make it more interesting & gorgeous. But unfortunately, this app was not used by RE because our lecturer had moved when it was just finished. It's available on my GitHub repository, but i've kept it private.
