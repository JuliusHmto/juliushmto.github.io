This project on airline customer segmentation utilized K-means clustering with the LRFMC model, an advanced adaptation of RFM detailed in the [paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/343777831_Analysis_Method_for_Customer_Value_of_Aviation_Big_Data_Based_on_LRFMC_Model). By analyzing travel habits, spending behaviors, and loyalty patterns, distinct customer segments were identified, providing valuable insights into customer interactions with airline services. These insights guided tailored marketing strategies, including personalized promotions and service enhancements, aimed at boosting customer satisfaction and loyalty. The project underscored the strategic value of data-driven segmentation in optimizing airline business outcomes.
