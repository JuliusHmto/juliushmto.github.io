I used the Kaggle dataset ["Should this loan be approved or denied?"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirbektoktogaraev/should-this-loan-be-approved-or-denied) to build a predictive model for loan approvals. Analyzing 899,164 business loan applications with a high default rate of 21.5%, I conducted thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover key patterns and trends. The project generated actionable insights and recommendations to help financial institutions reduce default rates and improve loan approval processes.
